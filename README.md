# Code
While creating code, I like to focus on the things that connect a project together, such as menus and anything else that is tied to the UI/UX.  
Code was written in C#.

CountdownTimer.cs:  

Code for a timer used in a minigame. There is a time limit of 120 seconds, and if the timer reaches 20 seconds, the numbers turn red to signify there is little time left.

Dialogue.cs:

Code for dialogue text boxes. You can wait for the dialogue boxes to fill out with text, or click on the box itself to autocomplete the text.
An additional click will take you to the next text box.

MainMenu.cs:

Code for the main menu of a game. With this, you can start the game or quit it.

Return.cs:

Code for a button that returns you back to the main menu.
